### About Us

We're students at Durham College studying Interactive Media Design

### How We Met

Abby and Cassie met at their workplace 2 and a half years ago. They both have similar interests and clicked from the beginning. Unbeknownst to the both of them, they were accepted into the same program and now they use their great chemistry to collaborate on creative projects in and outside of school.
